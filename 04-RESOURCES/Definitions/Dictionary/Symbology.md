# Symbology

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Symbology** is the visual representation of spatial features in a GIS, including the use of colors, symbols, and styles to convey information about the data. Effective symbology communicates geographic patterns clearly and enables users to interpret spatial data at a glance.

## Key Concepts

**Symbol** is a graphic element (marker, line, fill) representing a feature.
**Color ramp** is a gradient of colors representing a range of values.
**Classification** groups features into categories for distinct symbols.
**Transparency/Opacity** controls how much underlying features show through.
**Labeling** displays text annotations from feature attributes.
**Legend** explains the meaning of symbols on a map.

## Symbology Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Single symbol | Same symbol for all features | Simple reference maps |
| Unique values | Different symbol per category | Land use, zoning |
| Graduated colors | Color ramp by numeric value | Population density |
| Graduated symbols | Size by numeric value | City populations |
| Heat map | Density visualization | Event clusters |
