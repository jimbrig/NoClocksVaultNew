# Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
## Overview

**Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)** is a U.S. government agency responsible for coordinating disaster response and recovery efforts, as well as providing data on flood zones and other hazard areas. FEMA administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and maintains the authoritative source for flood hazard mapping in the United States.

## Key Concepts

**Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)** is the official map showing flood hazard zones and insurance risk.
**Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)** is an area with a 1% annual chance of flooding (100-year floodplain).
**Base Flood Elevation (BFE)** is the computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise.
**National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)** is the federal program providing flood insurance to property owners.
**Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)** is an official document that amends flood zone determinations.

## Flood Zone Designations

| Zone | Risk Level | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| A, AE, AH, AO | High | 1% annual chance (100-year flood) |
| V, VE | High | Coastal high-hazard with wave action |
| X (shaded) | Moderate | 0.2% annual chance (500-year flood) |
| X (unshaded) | Minimal | Outside 500-year floodplain |
| D | Undetermined | Possible but undetermined hazard |
