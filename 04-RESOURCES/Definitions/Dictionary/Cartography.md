# Cartography

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Cartography** is the science and art of making maps and charts. More broadly, the term includes all the steps necessary to produce a map: planning, aerial photography, drafting, editing, color separation, and multicolored printing. Modern cartography incorporates digital technologies, GIS, and interactive web mapping.

## Key Concepts

**Map projection** is the mathematical transformation of Earth's curved surface to a flat plane.
**Scale** is the ratio between map distance and real-world distance.
**Symbology** is the visual representation of features using colors, shapes, and patterns.
**Generalization** is the simplification of features for display at different scales.
**Typography** is the selection and placement of text labels on maps.
**Visual hierarchy** is the arrangement of map elements by importance.

## Map Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Topographic | Show terrain, elevation, natural features |
| Thematic | Display specific themes (population, climate) |
| Choropleth | Show data values by colored regions |
| Reference | General-purpose navigation and location |
| Cadastral | Property boundaries and ownership |
