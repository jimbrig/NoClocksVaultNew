includeLinks: true
debugInConsole: false
```

## Overview

> [!NOTE] About
> This folder contains audit logs generated by the `/audit-full` command. Each audit captures a point-in-time snapshot of vault health, including issues found and recommended actions.

## Audit Logs

> [!NOTE]
> *Currently, there are **`$= dv.pages('"' + dv.current().file.folder + '"').length - 1`** audit logs in this folder.*

```dataview
TABLE 
    file.ctime as "Created",
    file.size as "Size"
FROM "05-SYSTEM/Audit" 
AND -"05-SYSTEM/Audit/_README"
WHERE file.name != this.file.name
SORT file.ctime DESC
```

## Audit Categories

The full audit checks the following areas:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Frontmatter** | Required fields present (tags, description, author) |
| **Tags** | Status/Type/Topic tag conventions |
| **Links** | Broken wikilinks, orphaned notes |
| **Structure** | Notes in correct folders, naming conventions |
| **Content** | Empty sections, missing content |
| **Templates** | Template syntax, completeness |

## Health Score History

Track vault health over time:

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    file.link as "Audit",
    file.ctime as "Date"
FROM "05-SYSTEM/Audit"
WHERE contains(file.name, "AuditLog")
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Running an Audit

To generate a new audit log:

1. Open Cursor IDE in the vault
2. Run the `/audit-full` command
3. Review generated `AuditLog-YYYY-MM-DD.md` file
4. Work through action items by priority
