# International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** is an international body that develops and publishes standards, including those related to geospatial data and GIS technologies. ISO's Technical Committee 211 (TC 211) is responsible for geographic information standards.

## Key Concepts

**ISO 19115** defines metadata standards for geographic information.
**ISO 19139** provides XML encoding for ISO 19115 metadata.
**ISO 19107** covers spatial schema (geometry/topology).
**ISO 19111** defines coordinate reference systems.
**ISO 19125** specifies Simple Features for SQL.

## Key GIS Standards

| Standard | Topic |
|----------|-------|
| ISO 19115 | Metadata |
| ISO 19107 | Spatial schema |
| ISO 19111 | CRS |
| ISO 19125 | Simple Features |
| ISO 19136 | GML encoding |
