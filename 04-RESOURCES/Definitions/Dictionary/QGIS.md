# QGIS

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**QGIS** (formerly Quantum GIS) is a free and open-source Geographic Information System software that allows users to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish geospatial information on various operating systems. QGIS is one of the most widely used open-source GIS applications.

## Key Concepts

**Project file (.qgz/.qgs)** stores layer configurations, styles, and settings.
**Layer panel** manages data sources and visibility.
**Processing toolbox** provides access to hundreds of analysis tools.
**Plugin system** extends functionality with community-developed add-ons.
**Print composer** creates publication-quality maps.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Data formats | Supports most vector and raster formats via GDAL/OGR |
| Database support | PostGIS, SpatiaLite, Oracle, SQL Server |
| Web services | WMS, WFS, WCS, WMTS |
| Analysis | Vector, raster, network, and terrain analysis |
| Scripting | Python (PyQGIS) and graphical modeler |

## Core Dependencies

- [[Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)|GDAL/OGR]] for data access
- [[Geometry Engine - Open Source (GEOS)|GEOS]] for geometry operations
- PROJ for coordinate transformations
- Qt for user interface
