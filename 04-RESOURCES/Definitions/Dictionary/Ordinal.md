# Ordinal
## Overview

**Ordinal** refers to a type of categorical data that has a defined order or ranking among its categories, often used in GIS to represent qualitative attributes such as land use suitability or risk levels. Unlike interval data, the differences between ordinal values are not necessarily equal.

## Key Concepts

**Ranked categories** have a meaningful order (low < medium < high).
**Non-equal intervals** mean the difference between ranks may vary.
**Classification** groups continuous data into ordered categories.
**Natural breaks** is a classification method respecting data distribution.

## Examples in GIS

| Attribute | Ordinal Values |
|-----------|---------------|
| Flood risk | Low, Medium, High, Extreme |
| Soil drainage | Poor, Moderate, Well, Excessive |
| Road condition | Failed, Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent |
| Suitability | Unsuitable, Marginal, Suitable, Optimal |

## Measurement Scales

| Scale | Properties | GIS Example |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Nominal | Categories only | Land use type |
| Ordinal | Order/rank | Risk level |
| Interval | Equal intervals | Temperature (°C) |
| Ratio | True zero | Distance, area |
