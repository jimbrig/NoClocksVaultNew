# Web Map Service (WMS)
## Overview

**Web Map Service (WMS)** is a standard protocol developed by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).md) for serving georeferenced map images over the internet generated by a map server using data from a [GIS](Geographic Information System (GIS).md) database. WMS returns rendered images (PNG, JPEG, GIF) rather than raw data, making it suitable for displaying pre-styled map layers in web applications.

## Key Concepts

**GetCapabilities** is an operation that returns metadata about the WMS service, including available layers, supported formats, and coordinate systems.
**GetMap** is the primary operation that returns a map image based on specified parameters (layers, extent, size, format).
**GetFeatureInfo** is an optional operation that returns attribute information about features at a specific location.
**Layers** are named collections of geographic features available from the service.
**Styles** define how features are rendered visually (colors, symbols, line widths).

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Description |

| `SERVICE` | Service type (WMS) |
| `VERSION` | WMS version (1.1.1, 1.3.0) |
| `REQUEST` | Operation name (GetMap, GetCapabilities) |
| `LAYERS` | Comma-separated list of layer names |
| `BBOX` | Bounding box coordinates |
| `WIDTH` / `HEIGHT` | Image dimensions in pixels |
| `FORMAT` | Output format (image/png, image/jpeg) |
| `CRS` / `SRS` | Coordinate reference system |
