## Overview

Comprehensive glossary of **identity and access management (IAM)** terms. Useful for understanding authentication, authorization, and security concepts across platforms.

## A

- ##### Access Token
    
    Credential that can be used by an application to access an API. It informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that has been granted. An Access Token can be in any format, but two popular options include opaque strings and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). They should be transmitted to the API as a Bearer credential in an HTTP Authorization header.
    
    To learn more, see [Access Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens).
    
- ##### Account Linking
    
    Connecting user accounts across multiple platforms to allow users access to more than one resource or application by providing credentials one time.
    
- ##### Actions
    
    Secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.
    
    To learn more, see [Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).
    
- ##### Adaptive Multi-factor Authentication
    
    Multi-factor authentication (MFA) that is only triggered for users when an attempted login is determined to be a low confidence login. With Adaptive MFA, Auth0 triggers MFA only when needed to add friction for bad actors while keeping the login experience unchanged for good actors.
    
- ##### Application
    
    Your software that relies on Auth0 for authentication and identity management. Auth0 supports single-page, regular web, native, and machine-to-machine applications.
    
    To learn more, see [Applications in Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications).
    
- ##### Attack Protection
    
    Features that Auth0 provides to detect and mitigate attacks, including brute-force protection, suspicious IP throttling, breached password detection, bot detection, and adaptive multi-factor authentication.
    
    To learn more, see [Attack Protection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection).
    
- ##### Audience
    
    Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token, identified within a JSON Web Token as the **aud** claim. The audience value is either the application (`Client ID`) for an ID Token or the API that is being called (`API Identifier`) for an Access Token. At Auth0, the Audience value sent in a request for an Access Token dictates whether that token is returned in an opaque or JWT format.
    
- ##### Authorization Code
    
    Random string generated by the authorization server and returned to the application as part of the authorization response. The authorization code is relatively short-lived and is exchanged for an Access Token at the token endpoint when using the Authorization Code Flow (either with or without Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)).
    
- ##### Authorization Flow
    
    Another name for Authorization Grants outlined in OAuth 2.0. Authorization flows are the workflows a resource (an application or an API) uses to grant requestors access. Based on the type of technology (for example, if an application can store a Client Secret) and the type of requestor, resource owners can use Authorization Code Flow, Proof of Key Code Exchange (PKCE), Resource Owner Password Credential (ROPG), Implicit, or Client Credential.
    
- ##### Authorization Server
    
    Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user's access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user. An authorization server does not authenticate users. It's the role of the authentication server to verify a user's identity.

## B

- ##### Bad Actors
    
    Also known as threat actors. Entity (a person or group) that poses a threat to the business or environment with the intention to cause harm. Harm can constitute physical or cyber damages, from breaking into a data center to hacking into systems with stolen credentials.
    
- ##### Block/Unblock Users
    
    Removing or restoring a requestor's access to a resource. Refers to the features from Auth0's Attack Protection suite: Breached Password Detection, Brute-Force Protection, and Suspicious IP Throttling. Each service assesses login/sign-up trends and blocks IP addresses associated with suspicious activity.
    
- ##### Bot Detection
    
    Form of attack protection in which Auth0 blocks suspected bot traffic by enabling a CAPTCHA during the login process.
    
    To learn more, see [Bot Detection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection).
    
- ##### Breached Password Detection
    
    Form of attack protection in which Auth0 notifies your users if they use a username/password combination that has been compromised in a data leak on a third-party website or app.
    
    To learn more, see [Breached Password Detection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection).
    
- ##### Brute-force Protection
    
    Form of attack protection that safeguards against brute-force attacks that occur from a single IP address and target a single user account.
    
    To learn more, see [Brute-Force Protection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/brute-force-protection).

## C

- ##### Callback
    
    URL to which Auth0 sends its response after authentication. It is often the same URL to which a user is redirected after authentication.
    
- ##### Claim
    
    Attribute packaged in a security token which represents a claim that the provider of the token is making about an entity.
    
- ##### Client ID
    
    Identification value assigned to your application after registration. This value is used in conjunction with other third-party services and can be found in **Auth0 Dashboard** > **Application Settings**.
    
- ##### Client Secret
    
    Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable.
    
- ##### Confidential Client
    
    According to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, clients (applications) can be classified as either confidential or public depending on whether or not they are able to hold credentials (such as a client ID and secret) securely. Confidential clients can hold credentials in a secure way without exposing them to unauthorized parties and require a trusted backend server to do so.
    
    To learn more, see [Confidential and Public Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications).
    
- ##### Connection
    
    Relationship between Auth0 and the sources of users for your applications. Examples include identity providers (such as Google or Active Directory), passwordless authentication methods, or user databases.

## D

- ##### Digital Identity
    
    Set of attributes that define a particular user in the context of a function which is delivered by a particular application.
    
- ##### Digital Signature
    
    Encrypted string that protects bits in a token from tampering. If the bits are changed or tampered with, the signature will no longer be able to be verified and it will be rejected.
    
- ##### Directory
    
    Centralized repository of users (the most well-known of which is Active Directory) which centralizes credentials and attributes and makes it unnecessary for each application to have their own local identity setup and pool of users. Allows single sign on to all applications that use the same directory of users.

## I

- ##### ID Token
    
    Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource. It has a fixed format that clients can parse and validate.
    
    To learn more, see [ID Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens).
    
- ##### Identity Provider (IdP)
    
    Service that stores and manages digital identities. Auth0 supports trusted social, enterprise, and legal identity providers. Auth0 also can function as an identity provider for your applications.

## J

- ##### JSON Web Token (JWT)
    
    Open, industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. At Auth0, ID Tokens are always returned in JWT format, and Access Tokens are often in JWT format. You may decode well-formed JWTs at [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) to view their claims.
    
    To learn more, see [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens).

## M

- ##### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
    
    Authentication process that considers multiple factors. Typically at Auth0, the first factor is the standard username/password exchange, and the second is a code or link via email or SMS, a one-time-password via an app such as Authy or Google Authenticator, or a push notification via a phone app such as Guardian or Duo. Using multiple factors allows your account to remain secure if someone captures one or the other factor.
    
    To learn more, see [Multi-factor Authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication).

## N

- ##### Nonce
    
    Arbitrary (often random or pseudo-random) number issued in an authentication protocol that can be used to help detect and mitigate replay attacks using old communications. In other words, the nonce is only issued once, so if an attacker attempts to replay a transaction with a different nonce, its false transaction can be detected more easily.
    
    To learn more, see [Mitigate Replay Attacks](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/implicit-flow-with-form-post/mitigate-replay-attacks-when-using-the-implicit-flow).

## O

- ##### OAuth 2.0
    
    Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows. OAuth 2.0 defines roles, authorization grants (or workflows), authorization requests and responses, and token handling. OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols to verify user identity extends OAuth 2.0.
    
    To learn more, see [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth).
    
- ##### OpenID
    
    Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users are who they say they are without needing to collect, store, and therefore become liable for a user's login information.
    
    To learn more, see [OpenID Connect Protocol](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol).

## P

- ##### Passwordless
    
    Form of authentication where the first factor is not a password. Instead, it could be a one-time password received by email or SMS, a push notification, or a biometric sensor. Passwordless uses one-time passwords, so users are less susceptible to the typical password-based attacks.
    
    To learn more, see [Passwordless](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless).
    
- ##### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
    
    Extension to the Authorization Code flow that prevents CSRF and authorization code injection attacks. It is recommended for all OAuth clients, and required for mobile and single-page applications.
    
- ##### Public Client
    
    According to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, clients (applications) can be classified as either confidential or public depending on whether or not they are able to hold credentials (such as a client ID and secret) securely. Public clients cannot hold credentials securely, so should only use grant types that do not require the use of their client secret.
    
    To learn more, see [Confidential and Public Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications).

## R

- ##### Refresh Token
    
    Special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed Access Token. It is useful for renewing expiring Access Tokens without forcing the user to log in again. Using the Refresh Token, you can request a new Access Token at any time until the Refresh Token is blocklisted.
    
    To learn more, see [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens).
    
- ##### Refresh Token Rotation
    
    Strategy of frequently replacing refresh tokens to minimize vulnerability. With refresh token rotation, every time your application exchanges a refresh token to get a new access token, Auth0 also returns a new refresh token.
    
- ##### Role
    
    Aspect of a user's identity assigned to the user to indicate the level of access they should have to the system. Roles are essentially collections of permissions.
    
    To learn more, see [Role-Based Access Control](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac).

## S

- ##### Scope
    
    Mechanism that defines the specific actions applications can be allowed to do or information that they can request on a user's behalf. When an app requests permission to access a resource through an authorization server, it uses the Scope parameter to specify what access it needs.
    
    To learn more, see [Scopes](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/scopes).
    
- ##### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
    
    XML-based standardized protocol by which two parties can exchange authentication information without the use of a password.
    
    To learn more, see [SAML](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml).
    
- ##### Security Token
    
    Digitally-signed artifact used to prove that the user was successfully authenticated.
    
- ##### Session Cookie
    
    Entity emitted by middleware after it establishes that the token it is receiving is signed, valid, and comes from a trusted source (the identity provider). This entity represents the fact that successful authentication occurred.
    
- ##### Single Sign-On (SSO)
    
    Service that, after a user logs into one application, automatically logs that user in to other applications, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using. The user signs in only one time (hence the name of the feature).
    
    To learn more, see [Single Sign-On](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on).

## T

- ##### Tenant
    
    A logically-isolated group of users who share common access with specific privileges to a single software instance. No tenant can access the data of another tenant, even though multiple tenants might be running on the same machine.
    
- ##### Token Endpoint
    
    Endpoint on the Authorization Server that is used to programmatically request tokens.

## U

- ##### Universal Login
    
    Auth0's implementation of the authentication flow, which is the key feature of an Authorization Server. Each time a user needs to prove their identity, your applications redirect to Universal Login, and Auth0 will do what's needed to guarantee the user's identity.
    
    To learn more, see [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login).

## W

- ##### Web Service Federation (WS-Fed)
    
    Protocol for managing user identities between systems, domains, and identity providers with established trust using WS-Trust. This protocol is mainly used for Microsoft products and defines policies on how to share federation metadata.
