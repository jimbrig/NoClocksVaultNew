**ai**: What would you like to research specifically about this note? Here are a few focused options I can do next:

- Fill in the missing OGC API entries (Moving Features, Records, Connected Systems, DGGS, Routes, Joins) with concise descriptions and current status.
- Add missing modern standards (e.g., [OGC API - Styles](OGC API - Styles.md), [OGC API - Coverages](OGC API - Coverages.md)) and clarify how they relate to legacy WMS/WFS/WCS.
- Map ArcGIS service types to OGC equivalents (e.g., Feature Service ⇔ OGC API - Features) with pros/cons and interoperability notes.
- Add practical usage examples (typical endpoints, sample requests/responses, formats, filtering with CQL2).
- Summarize client/server implementations (GeoServer, MapServer, pygeoapi, ArcGIS Server) and conformance classes.
- Produce a comparison table: Legacy OGC vs OGC API (capabilities, formats, filtering, transactions, tiling, styling, auth).

If you want, I can start by drafting updates directly for this note. Which section should I prioritize?
