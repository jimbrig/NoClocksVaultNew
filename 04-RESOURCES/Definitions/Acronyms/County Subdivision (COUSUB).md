# County Subdivision (COUSUB)
## Overview

**County Subdivision (COUSUB)** is a geographic area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau that represents minor civil divisions within a county, such as towns, townships, or precincts. The type and nature of county subdivisions vary significantly by state based on local government structures.

## Key Concepts

**Minor Civil Division (MCD)** is the primary governmental or administrative division of a county in many states.
**Census County Division (CCD)** is a Census-created subdivision for states without MCDs.
**Unorganized territory** is an area with no active county subdivision government.
**GEOID** combines state (2) + county (3) + COUSUB (5) codes.

## Types by State

| State Type | Subdivision Name | Examples |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| New England | Town | Connecticut, Massachusetts |
| Midwest | Township | Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania |
| South | Precinct/District | Louisiana parishes |
| West | CCD (Census-created) | Most western states |
