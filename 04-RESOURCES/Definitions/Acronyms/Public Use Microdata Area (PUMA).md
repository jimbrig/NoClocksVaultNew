# Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA)
## Overview

**Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA)** is a geographic area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for the dissemination of public use microdata samples, typically containing a population of at least 100,000 people. PUMAs enable researchers to access individual-level census responses while protecting respondent privacy.

## Key Concepts

**Microdata** is individual-level survey response data (anonymized).
**PUMS** (Public Use Microdata Sample) is the dataset containing individual records.
**Population threshold** is the minimum 100,000 population required for privacy protection.
**State-based** means PUMAs do not cross state boundaries.
**Nesting** ensures PUMAs are built from whole census tracts.

## Use Cases

- Custom demographic tabulations not available in standard products
- Multivariate analysis of individual characteristics
- Statistical modeling and microsimulation
- Academic and policy research
