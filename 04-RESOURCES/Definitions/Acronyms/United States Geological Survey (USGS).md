# United States Geological Survey (USGS)
## Overview

**United States Geological Survey (USGS)** is a scientific agency of the U.S. government that studies landscape, natural resources, and natural hazards, providing valuable geographic and geological data.

## Key Concepts

**Topographic maps** are detailed maps showing terrain, elevation, and natural/man-made features.
**National Map** is USGS's comprehensive geographic database of the United States.
**Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS)** is USGS's center for remote sensing data.
**StreamStats** is a web application for watershed analysis and streamflow statistics.
**3DEP** is the 3D Elevation Program providing high-resolution elevation data.
