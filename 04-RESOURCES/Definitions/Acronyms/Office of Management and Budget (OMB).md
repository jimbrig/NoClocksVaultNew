# Office of Management and Budget (OMB)

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Office of Management and Budget (OMB)** is a U.S. government agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of the President's vision across the Executive Branch, including defining statistical areas such as Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas. OMB establishes standards for federal statistical programs and geographic classifications used in census and economic data.

## Key Concepts

**Statistical areas** are geographic units defined for collecting and reporting statistical data.
**Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)** is a CBSA with at least one urbanized area of 50,000+ population.
**Micropolitan Statistical Area** is a CBSA with an urban cluster of 10,000-49,999 population.
**Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)** is a geographic area anchored by an urban center with socioeconomically tied counties.
**OMB Bulletins** are official publications that update statistical area definitions.

## Geographic Classifications

OMB defines and maintains standards for:
- [[Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)|Metropolitan Statistical Areas]]
- [[Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)|Core-Based Statistical Areas]]
- [[Combined Statistical Area (CSA)|Combined Statistical Areas]]
- Principal cities and urban areas
