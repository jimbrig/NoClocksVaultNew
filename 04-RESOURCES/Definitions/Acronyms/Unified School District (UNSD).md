# Unified School District (UNSD)

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Unified School District (UNSD)** is a type of school district in the United States that serves students from kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12). Unlike areas with separate elementary and secondary districts, unified districts provide a continuous educational pathway under a single administrative structure.

## Key Concepts

**K-12 coverage** refers to serving all grade levels from kindergarten through high school graduation.
**Single administration** is the unified governance structure overseeing all schools in the district.
**Geographic boundary** is the defined area from which students are enrolled.
**NCES code** is the National Center for Education Statistics unique identifier for school districts.
