# Parcel
## Overview

**Parcel** is a defined piece of land, often represented as a polygon in GIS, typically used for property ownership and land use analysis. Parcels are the fundamental unit of land ownership records and form the basis of property tax administration, real estate transactions, and land planning.

## Key Concepts

**Parcel ID (PIN/APN)** is a unique identifier assigned by the local assessor.
**Legal description** is the official textual description of parcel boundaries.
**Cadastral map** is a map showing property boundaries and ownership.
**Metes and bounds** is a legal description using directions and distances.
**Lot and block** is a description referencing a recorded subdivision plat.
**Assessment** is the valuation of property for tax purposes.
