# Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)
## Overview

**Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)** is a U.S. geographic area defined by the [Office of Management and Budget](Office of Management and Budget (OMB).md) that consists of one or more counties anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center. CBSAs are classified into Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Micropolitan Statistical Areas based on population size.

## Key Concepts

**Urban core** is the densely settled area that anchors a CBSA.
**Central county** is the county containing all or the largest portion of the urban core.
**Outlying county** is a county with strong commuting ties to the central county.
**Principal city** is the largest city in the CBSA and other qualifying cities.
**Commuting threshold** is the 25% minimum employment interchange for outlying counties.

## Classification

| Type | Urban Core Population | Example |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| Metropolitan (MSA) | 50,000+ | Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta |
| Micropolitan (μSA) | 10,000-49,999 | Rome, GA |

## CBSA Codes

- 5-digit numeric codes assigned by OMB
- Updated periodically (typically after each decennial census)
- Example: 35620 = New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA
