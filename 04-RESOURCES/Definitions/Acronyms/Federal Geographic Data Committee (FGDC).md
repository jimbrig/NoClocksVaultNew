# Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
## Overview

**Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)** is a U.S. government committee that promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national level. FGDC coordinates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and develops metadata standards.

## Key Concepts

**National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)** is the framework for sharing geospatial data.
**FGDC metadata standard** defines documentation requirements for geospatial data.
**Geospatial data clearinghouse** is a network of distributed data servers.
**Framework data** are foundational layers (geodetic control, orthoimagery, elevation, etc.).
**Geospatial Platform** is GeoPlatform.gov for federal data sharing.

## FGDC Framework Themes

- Geodetic Control
- Orthoimagery
- Elevation
- Transportation
- Hydrography
- Governmental Units
- Cadastral
