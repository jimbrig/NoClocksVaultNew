# Google Earth Engine (GEE)
## Overview

**Google Earth Engine (GEE)** is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis, providing access to a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. GEE enables large-scale analysis without downloading data or managing infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

**Data Catalog** contains petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial data.
**Code Editor** is a web-based IDE for writing analysis scripts.
**Image** is a raster dataset with bands and metadata.
**ImageCollection** is a stack of images (time series).
**Feature** is a vector geometry with properties.
**FeatureCollection** is a collection of Features.
**Reducer** aggregates data (mean, sum, histogram).

## Available Datasets

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Landsat | 50+ years of imagery |
| Sentinel-2 | 10m multispectral |
| MODIS | Daily global coverage |
| SRTM | Global elevation |
| NLCD | US land cover |

## Programming

- JavaScript (Code Editor)
- Python (earthengine-api)
- R (rgee package)
