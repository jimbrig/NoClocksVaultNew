# Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
## Overview

**Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)** is a remote sensing method that uses laser pulses to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of the Earth's surface and features. LIDAR provides high-accuracy elevation data used for terrain modeling, forestry, urban planning, and flood mapping.

## Key Concepts

**Point cloud** is the raw collection of XYZ points from laser returns.
**First return** is the first surface encountered (vegetation canopy, buildings).
**Last return** is typically the ground surface beneath vegetation.
**Point density** is the number of points per unit area (pts/m²).
**Classification** categorizes points (ground, vegetation, building, water).
**Intensity** is the strength of the laser return signal.

## LIDAR Types

| Type | Platform | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Airborne | Aircraft, helicopter | Regional mapping |
| Terrestrial | Ground-based tripod | Site documentation |
| Mobile | Vehicle-mounted | Corridor mapping |
| UAV/Drone | Small aircraft | Local surveys |
| Bathymetric | Aircraft (green laser) | Underwater mapping |
