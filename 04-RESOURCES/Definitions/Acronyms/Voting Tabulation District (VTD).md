# Voting Tabulation District (VTD)

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Voting Tabulation District (VTD)** is a geographic area defined for the purpose of tabulating election results, often used in redistricting and electoral analysis. VTDs typically correspond to voting precincts or election districts established by state and local governments.

## Key Concepts

**Precinct** is the local term for a voting district where voters cast ballots at a designated polling place.
**Redistricting** is the process of redrawing electoral district boundaries using VTD building blocks.
**GEOID** is the unique identifier combining state, county, and VTD codes.
**Pseudo-VTD** is a Census-created VTD for areas where states did not provide boundaries.
