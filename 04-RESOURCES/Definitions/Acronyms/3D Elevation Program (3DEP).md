# 3D Elevation Program (3DEP)
## Overview

**3D Elevation Program (3DEP)** is an initiative led by the [USGS](United States Geological Survey (USGS).md) to provide high-resolution, three-dimensional elevation data for the entire United States. 3DEP aims to complete nationwide coverage with quality level 2 (QL2) LiDAR or better.

## Key Concepts

**Quality Level (QL)** defines data specifications (point density, accuracy).
**QL2** is 2+ points/m² with 10cm vertical accuracy (standard target).
**QL1** is 8+ points/m² for higher resolution needs.
**QL0** is special high-density collection (urban, corridors).
**Bare Earth DEM** is the gridded surface derived from LiDAR points.
**Point cloud** is the original LiDAR returns with classification.

## Quality Levels

| Level | Point Density | Vertical Accuracy |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| QL0 | ≥8 pts/m² | ≤5 cm |
| QL1 | ≥8 pts/m² | ≤10 cm |
| QL2 | ≥2 pts/m² | ≤10 cm |

## Data Access

- The National Map (USGS)
- USGS LiDAR Explorer
- AWS Open Data (via Entwine)
- Google Earth Engine
