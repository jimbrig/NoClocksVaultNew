# Audit Content Gaps

Identify areas that need content, polish, or expansion.

## Gap Analysis

### 1. Empty/Stub Folders

Folders with few or no notes:

| Folder | Expected Content |
|--------|------------------|
| `01-SLIPBOX/` | Atomic permanent notes |
| `02-PROJECTS/` | Active project documentation |
| `04-RESOURCES/Articles/` | Article summaries/notes |
| `04-RESOURCES/Books/` | Book notes and summaries |
| `04-RESOURCES/Cheatsheets/` | Quick reference guides |
| `04-RESOURCES/Lists/` | Curated resource lists |

### 2. Incomplete Notes

Find notes that are drafts or need work:
<!-- dynamic content -->
