# National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL)
## Overview

**National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL)** is a digital database maintained by [FEMA](Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).md) that provides flood hazard information, including flood zones, base flood elevations, and floodplain boundaries. The NFHL is a geospatial compilation of effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) data and is the authoritative source for flood hazard determinations.

## Key Concepts

**Flood zone** is a geographic area classified by flood risk level (A, V, X zones).
**Base flood elevation (BFE)** is the computed height of the 1% annual chance flood.
**Floodway** is the channel and adjacent areas that must remain unobstructed for floodwater passage.
**Coastal barrier resource** is protected coastal areas with development restrictions.
**LOMR** (Letter of Map Revision) reflects physical changes to flood hazard boundaries.

## Data Layers

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| S_FLD_HAZ_AR | Flood hazard zones (primary layer) |
| S_BFE | Base flood elevation lines |
| S_XS | Cross-section lines |
| S_FIRM_PAN | FIRM panel boundaries |
| S_LOMR | Letters of Map Revision |

## Access Methods

- FEMA Map Service Center (MSC)
- FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) Viewer
