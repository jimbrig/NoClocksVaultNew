# Orthogonal

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Orthogonal** refers to a coordinate system or projection where the axes are at right angles (90 degrees) to each other, allowing for accurate representation of spatial relationships in a GIS. Orthogonal coordinates simplify distance and area calculations.

## Key Concepts

**Right angle** is a 90-degree angle between axes.
**Cartesian coordinates** use orthogonal X and Y axes.
**Orthophoto** is an aerial image geometrically corrected to uniform scale.
**Grid system** uses orthogonal rows and columns.

## Applications

- Cartesian coordinate systems
- Orthophoto production from aerial imagery
- Regular raster grids
- Engineering surveys
