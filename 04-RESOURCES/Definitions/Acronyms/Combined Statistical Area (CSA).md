# Combined Statistical Area (CSA)

```table-of-contents
```

## Overview

**Combined Statistical Area (CSA)** is a U.S. geographic area defined by the [[Office of Management and Budget (OMB)|Office of Management and Budget]] that consists of two or more adjacent [[Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)|Core-Based Statistical Areas]] with substantial employment interchange. CSAs represent larger regional economic areas and labor markets.

## Key Concepts

**Employment interchange** is the measure of commuting between adjacent CBSAs that determines CSA membership.
**Commuting threshold** is the 15% minimum employment interchange required for combination.
**Component CBSAs** are the metropolitan and micropolitan areas that make up a CSA.
**Principal city** is the largest city in each component CBSA.

## Examples

| CSA | Population | Components |
|-----|------------|------------|
| New York-Newark | ~23M | NYC Metro, Bridgeport, Trenton, etc. |
| Los Angeles-Long Beach | ~18M | LA Metro, Riverside, Oxnard |
| Chicago-Naperville | ~10M | Chicago Metro, Gary, Kankakee |
